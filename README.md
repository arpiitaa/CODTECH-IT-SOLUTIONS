OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : IMAGE RECOGNITION BY DEEP LEARNING

Objective:
Develop an image recognition system that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction, aiming to improve recognition accuracy for tasks involving sequential or time-series data.

1. Introduction:-
   
Background:
Image recognition has advanced significantly with deep learning techniques.CNNs are effective in extracting spatial features from images.
LSTMs are suitable for handling sequential data, making them ideal for tasks where context or sequence matters (e.g., video frames, gesture recognition).

Motivation:
Combining CNNs and LSTMs leverages the strengths of both architectures.
Potential applications include video analysis, activity recognition, and real-time object tracking.

2. Architecture:-
   
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Purpose: Extract spatial features from images.
Components:
Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
Fully connected layers for classification.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network:
Purpose: Process sequential data and capture temporal dependencies.
Components:
LSTM layers to handle sequences of feature vectors from CNN.
Fully connected layers for final prediction.

3. Data Pipeline:-
   
Data Collection:
Gather a dataset suitable for the task (e.g., a video dataset for activity recognition).

Data Preprocessing:
Resize and normalize images.
Split video data into frames (if applicable).
Create sequences of frames for LSTM input.

5. Model Training:-
   
Training CNN:
Train the CNN on image data to extract features.
Use a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for pre-training if necessary.
Feature Extraction:
Use the trained CNN to extract features from each frame of the sequence.
Training LSTM:
Train the LSTM on sequences of features extracted by the CNN.
Use the sequence labels (e.g., action labels for video sequences) for supervision.

5. Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for classification tasks.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
Validation:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Use cross-validation if data is limited.

6. Implementation:-
   
Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model development.
OpenCV for image and video processing.
Steps:
Load Data:
Load and preprocess images/videos.
Build CNN Model:
